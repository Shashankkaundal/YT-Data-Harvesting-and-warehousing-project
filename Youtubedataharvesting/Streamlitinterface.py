        The Project has below functionalities:
        
        #Ability to input a YouTube channel ID and retrieve all the relevant data (Channel name, subscribers, total video count, playlist ID, video ID, likes, dislikes, comments of each video) using Google API.
        
        #Ability to collect data for up to 10 different YouTube channels and store them in the database clicking a button.
        
        #Option to store the data in a MYSQL.
        
        #Ability to search and retrieve data from the SQL database using different search options.
